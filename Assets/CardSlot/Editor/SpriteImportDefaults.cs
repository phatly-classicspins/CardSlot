    /// a 1x1 unit sprite — a silent 100x error with no gate. This is the other half of the chain whose
    /// runtime half is <c>WorldSpaceCanvasScaler</c>, which pins
    /// <c>Canvas.referencePixelsPerUnit = 1</c>. uGUI computes
    /// <c>Image.pixelsPerUnit = sprite.pixelsPerUnit / canvas.referencePixelsPerUnit</c>; only 1/1 == 1
    /// makes <c>SetNativeSize()</c> on a 100x100 sprite produce a 100x100 rect. Sizing therefore comes

    ///
    /// <para><b>Why every decision is logged.</b> A silent no-op is a defect: an import that quietly
    /// declines to act is indistinguishable from a postprocessor that never ran. So every <i>in-scope
    /// sprite</i> emits exactly one line naming the asset path and the PPU actually in force. Severity
    /// splits by meaning — "already 1" is informational (the invariant holds, the line only proves the
    /// hook ran), while "PPU != 1" is a warning that spells the consequence out in units, because that

    /// consequences, both intended: a texture Preset does not beat this default, and any postprocessor
    /// left at the default order 0 does. That second one is the escape hatch — a subfolder needing a
    /// different PPU gets its own postprocessor at order 0, with no edit here and none in the

    ///
    /// <para><b>Naming.</b> The C# member is <see cref="TextureImporter.spritePixelsPerUnit"/>.
