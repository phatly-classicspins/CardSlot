# Tools/Gate/gate.conf.sh — this SKU's settings for the framework's Tools/pf/gate.sh.
#
# SKU-OWNED (emitted once by the Setup Wizard's test kit). Sourced by Tools/pf/gate.sh before any leg
# runs; plain POSIX sh, no side effects beyond setting the names below. Run the gate with
# `sh Tools/pf/gate.sh`.

# --- Leg 4 (optional): ONE [Slow] test the gate still owns, keyed on its inputs. -----------------
# A Slow test is excluded from leg 3 by `TestCategory!=Slow`. When one of them guards something the
# gate must not lose — a generator's byte-for-byte determinism, say — name it here: the gate runs it
# BY NAME (never the whole Slow set) whenever the hash of keyed_test_inputs' files differs from the
# last green run's, and reports it REUSED otherwise. Under-scoping the input list is the one way this
# goes quietly wrong, so err wide.
